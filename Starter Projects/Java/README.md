# Java Starter Client
Has its own .gitignore for Java specifically.

# Building The Project
Disclaimer: I know next to nothing about Java, but you should just need to make sure you have JDK installed, and have/let Maven run in your project.


Install Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
Download Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

The pom.xml file should have everything you need in it.

I also had to "add JUnit to class path", I'm not sure whether or not this is done as part of what I push, but if you're using intellij it should be a suggested fix.
