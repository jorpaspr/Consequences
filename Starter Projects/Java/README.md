# Java Starter Client
Has its own .gitignore for Java specifically.

# Building The Project
Disclaimer: I know next to nothing about Java. There was some kind of mix of downloading Java SDK 19, setting something (language version?) to 11, and then downloading Maven to install gson.


Install Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
Download Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

The pom.xml file should have everything you need in it.

I also had to "add JUnit to class path", I'm not sure whether or not this is done as part of what I push, but if you're using intellij it should be a suggested fix.
